# Genetic-Algorithm
The creation of a genetic algorithm for a defined fitness function is performed. An initial population of five individuals is implemented, using the method of selection of parents by roulette, with a predefined crossover probability, in addition to implementing the method of crossover by recombination.
The bit-reversal mutation method is also used, with a predefined mutation probability. Finally, survivor selection is performed using the weakest parent method.
Note: The stopping condition is ten generations.
